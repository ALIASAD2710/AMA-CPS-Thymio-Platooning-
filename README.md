# AMA-CPS-Thymio-Platooning-
This project is aimed at realization of various thymio operating scenarios such as platooning, collision and simulation using Thymio simulator. The system of system under observation is composed of four thymio-2 robots and a virtual map of a typical traffic system with Two- bidirectional lanes is considered for this experiment.
